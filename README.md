# hello-world
The Hello World project is a time-honored tradition in computer programming so i made this repository and also to say Hi, i mean Hello World!

My name is Sameh, I'm from Egypt. I love progrmming in general. Currently i know SQL, C Language, Little bit of Java and Python. I also studied HTML, CSS and JS a while ago just for the sake of knowledge.
I recently learnt basic shell basg commands also Github tutorials.
 I am currently intesrested in Data Analysis Track, but I am willing to learn more to become a data scientest, so wish me luck.
